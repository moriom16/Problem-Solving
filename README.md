# Problem-Solving
First Solve the Problem, Then Write the Code

**Problem Solving**

This repository contains solutions to various programming problems. The problems are organized into different categories, such as:

Algorithms: This category contains problems that involve implementing algorithms. 

Data structures: This category contains problems that involve using data structures.

Logic: This category contains problems that involve logical reasoning.

Other: This category contains problems that don't fit into any of the other categories.




In addition to the solutions, I also include the following information for each problem:

The problem statement

A link to the problem's source (if available)

A discussion of the problem-solving approach

A link to the code (if available)

I hope this repository will be a helpful resource for those who are learning to solve problems. I also welcome contributions from others.
